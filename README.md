# About Me
I'm a passionate, hardworking student seeking to gain professional experience from a position where skills of unstructured problem solving, effective communication, and resilience will be indispensable.

I'm a full-stack developer particularly intrigued by the IoT and distributed systems. I have extensive experience with .NET, ASP.NET, React.js & ts, Python, Java, SQL, HTML & CSS, flask, Jinja, JavaScript, and Powershell.

See my stats below. The languages are not very representative of what I spend most time in, as most of my code is private.
